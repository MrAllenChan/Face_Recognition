# GradProject_FaceRecognition

This is the graduation project I finished in BUPT, Beijing.

## Project Topic:
- Design and implementation of a face recognition system on mobile platform.

### Abstract:

Face recognition technology is a very classic and popular biometric technology. By analysing and comparing people's facial features, face recognition can accurately and effectively identify different identities. Nowadays, with the rapid development of various computer technologies such as machine learning, face recognition technology has reached a very advanced level. At the same time, the revolution of mobile Internet and the popularization of smart mobile devices, have greatly brought down the barriers to utilize face recognition technology, expanded the scenario of applying face recognition, and further promoted the development of face recognition based on mobile devices. Based on machine learning techniques, mobile application development and wireless communication, this project successfully designed and implemented a mobile application with face recognition function and good interactive experience. The whole system is divided into mobile-end and server-end. The mobile-end has a friendly user interface, which can collect face images, send them to the server and present prediction results. The server-end loads the face recognition model, analyses faces, obtains the prediction results and returns them to the mobile-end. This report will introduce the background and relevant techniques as well as the design and implementation process of the project in detail. Also, the demonstration of the system and the experimental analysis of the system, will be described in detail in this report. Finally, this report will summarize the work and achievements of the project, and look forward to possible future extensions and improvements.
